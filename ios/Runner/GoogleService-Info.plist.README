iOS Firebase Configuration
==========================

To enable iOS builds, you need to:

1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/calycompta
2. Click on iOS app (or add one if not exists)
3. Download GoogleService-Info.plist
4. Place it in this directory: ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist

Bundle ID should be: com.calypsodc.calymob (or your chosen bundle identifier)

Without this file, iOS builds will fail with Firebase initialization errors.
