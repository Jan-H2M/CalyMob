# Archive Directory

This directory contains deprecated files that are no longer needed for the project.

## `/to-delete`
These files can be safely deleted:
- Duplicate numbered scripts (e.g., `* 2.js`, `* 3.cjs`)
- Old test migration scripts
- Duplicate configuration files
- These were created during various migrations and are no longer needed

## `/old-configs`
Old configuration files kept for reference but not actively used:
- Previous Vercel setup configurations
- Old deployment configurations

## Recommendation
The entire `archive` directory can be deleted once you've confirmed everything is working correctly with the new structure.
